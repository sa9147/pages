 Flower poem
 <br>
 <h2>
 A feild of flowers
 </h2>
 <p>
 a field of grass so blue and green
 <br>
a field of flowers never seen
<br>
spirits surrounded in colors and hues
<br>
and music singing at the joyous views
<br>
<br>
hope first blooms as rose in a sea
<br>
at first obliterating reality
<br>
then it fades, the flower wilts
<br>
until it dies, no longer gilt
<br>
music sounding its sad adieu
<br>
the colours in dreams no longer imbue
 </p>
